Regions - all over world, cluster of data centres (most services are region scoped) which region to choose
Choice- compliance data governance, legacy req.
Proximity- close to user/customer
Available service - new services are not available in all regions
Pricing - varies across region
Availability Zone - (min 3 AZ n max 6 AZ)
One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and disasters -separated from each others but locally in distance, high bandwidth, ultra low latency connected.
Edge Locations - content delivery with lowest latency
Global services- IAM, Route 53, cloudfront, WAF

Section 1- IAM 
global service - Root account by default, no sharing, get MFA
Users are people you can grouped. as developers group - can contain users only in group n not other group
users/groups -assigned with json document to get policy
IAM Policies -

action- list of actions tthis policy allow or denies
Resource= list of resources to which action aapplies
condition- optional- when policy is effective from
Aws Management console -acess using username/password or mfa
aws command line interface- by access key
sdk - through access key
user's can generate access for their account and get access key and secret key

Roles - created for aws service to access other aws services on behalf of you. these are temporary.
IAM security Tools(account level)- Credentials report- list all users and status of crednetials
IAM access Advisor(user level)show service permisions to use n when those are used last time.

Guideline and best practices -
dont use root account for daily usage
one physical user= one aws user
strong password policy
use mfa
assign users to group and policies to group
use access key,secretkey for aws cli and sdk
audit permission using iam credential report
