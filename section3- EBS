EBS- elastic block store- network drive you can attach to ec2 while they are running. (network usb stick)
one instance at a time, specific to availability zone, persist data even instance is terminated.
Default EBS attached to EC2 is defaulted to delete on termincation while EBS volume is unchecked for delete on termincation by default (we can enable/disable)

Snapshot - backup of ebs volume.  copy from az or to region as well
Snapshot archive - 75% cheaper - 24 to 72 hours to restore in archive
recycle bin for ebs snapshot - setup rule to retain deleted snapshot - specify retention period
Fast snapshot restore (fsr) - force full inialization of snapshot to have no latency on first use

AMI- amazon Machine Image 
customization of EC2 instance- add your software,os, config, monitor
faster boot/config time 
built for specific region
PUblic AMI- AWS provided 
your onw AMI- make and maintain
AWS marketplace- ami someone created 

EC2 Instance Store- attahced to instace, fast, loss of data on terminzation or restart or hardware failure

EBS columetype-s
gp2/go3( SSD) - balance proce and performance
io1/io2 (ssd) high performance for mission critical low latency high throughput
st 1(HDD)- low cost frequenctly accessedd, instensive workload
sc 1(HDD) - lowest cost, less frequently accessed

EBS Encryption - data at rest as well as moving between instance n volume,
snapshot is encrypted, volume created from snapshot is also encrypted. no impact on latency(minimal)  (AES encryption algo)

EFA (elastic file system) network file system - (file sharing)
works with multi az
highly available ,scalable, expensive ,compatible with linux only, use SG to control access

 storage tiers -
   1. standard- for freuently access files 
   2. infrequency access - cost to retrive files, lower price to store, EFS-IA with lifecycle policy
   
   Availability n durability
   Standard- multi az for prod
   one zone- less available , for test env
